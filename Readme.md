## Winter Weekend 2022 Java Midterm


### SUBMISSION PROCESS :
- Deadline: April 10th @ 10AM
- Clone the project locally
- Add all required dependencies to the project (these can be found in the `lib` directory)
- Create your own public repository in GitHub and name it: "<StudentID_FirstName> Java Midterm"
- Once you create your GitHub repo, [click here to add your repo URL](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1apZkiNY3ctpmyT6SnP2jW85-w41QeYmyraBeudCi4Ao/edit?usp=sharing)
- Point your local repo to your newly created remote repo and verify it is pointing to the correct repo 
`git remote -v` 
  - If not, change which remote repo your local is pointing to by using the following command: 
`git remote set-url <existing remote name> <new repo URL>`
- You must be pushing code to the repo on a consistent basis
  - Best practice (in real life), is to push your code every time you solve a problem, make a change, or finish a task.
  - ***IMPORTANT: DO NOT PUSH ANY CODE CONTAINING ANY ERRORS***

### IMPORTANT NOTES :
- Must complete all coding problems.
- Read the questions thoroughly and understand what is being asked of you. There are files in the project that are there for you to review. 
  - Try to understand how everything is working.
- Google should be used to learn, however, don't feel free to copy and paste answers. You only hurt yourself if you copy and don't try
to understand the solution
- Once submissions are in, we will be reviewing the midterm in class together.


#### ***ENJOY THE PROCESS & GOOD LUCK!***
