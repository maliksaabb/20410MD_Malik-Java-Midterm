     *
     * Create an API to read the .txt file and print it to the console.
     *      HINT: Use BufferedReader class
     * Use try-catch block to handle any exceptions
     *
     * Store and retrieve the file to/from a database table.
     *
     * After reading from file using BufferedReader API, store each word, first into a LinkedList. Each word
     * should construct a node in LinkedList. Second, do the same, but with a Stack.
     * Finally, traverse through the list\stack & retrieve each item in `FIFO` order and `FILO` order, respectively
     *
     * Demonstrate how to use a stack using push, peek, search & pop methods.
     * Use For-Each & While-loop with Iterator to retrieve/print data.
