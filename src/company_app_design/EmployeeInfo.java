     *
     * This class should implement the Employee interface, but you must do that without using the keyword `implements`
     * anywhere in this class.
     *
     * HINT: Take a look at the collections framework diagram. Do you see how a class may implement an interface without
     *       directly implementing it?
     *
     * YOU MUST USE/DO:
     *         OOP (Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance and Polymorphism) concepts in every way possible
     *         Use all kind of keywords (super, this, static, final, etc)
     *         Implement nested class below (DateConversion)
     *         Use Exception Handling
     *
     * Once you're done with designing this EmployeeInfo class, go to the CompanyEmployee class to test
